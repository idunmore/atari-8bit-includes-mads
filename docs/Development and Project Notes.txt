CURRENT STATUS:

  The status for each of the main files is as follows:

   Custom ICs:

    - ANTIC           - Complete
    - GTIA            - Complete
    - PIA             - Complete
    - POKEY           - Complete

   OS, Cartridges & Utilities/Macros:

    - BASIC           - Complete
    - OS              - Complete
    - DOS             - RUNAD & INITAD done; needs remainder of vectors and tables.
    
    - colors          - NTSC and PAL Color Constant Definitions
    - common          - In Progress (changes only additive)
    - character_set   - Complete
    - display_list    - Complete
    - macro_debugging - Complete
    - vertical_blank  - Complete

  [Note: "Complete" is relative.  Typically it indicates all documented registers
  values and so on have been covered.  However, additional work/refinements and/or
  NON-BREAKING changes in conventions/commentary may be applied.]

TODOs:

  * Currently using a couple of different styles for detailed annotation
    of various registers and memory location (see below).  NEED to choose a
    single style, and then update ALL files to follow it.

    Noting that there is probably some cross over point (2 or maybed 3 lines)
    where the first "inline" sense makes sense vs. the second style:

        COUNTR = $7E ; [WORD] S: Loop control for line drawing.  Starts out containing
                     ;        the larger value of either DELTAR or DELTAC. This is the
                     ;        number of iterations required to draw a line. As each
                     ;        point on a line is drawn, this value is decremented. When
                     ;        COUNTR equals zero, the line is complete.

      vs.

        ; ROWINC and COLINC control the direction of the line drawing routine. The
        ; values represent the signs derived from the value in NEWROW, minus the value
        ; in ROWCRS and the value in NEWCOL minus the value in COLCRS.

        ROWINC = $79 ; [BYTE] Row INCrecemet or DECrement value (plus, or minus, 1)
        COLINC = $7A ; [BYTE] Column INCrecemet or DECrement value (plus, or minus, 1)

  * Make inline punctuation, separators and end-of-line PERIODs consistent, and
    update for ALL files.
