# Experimental Files & Concepts
Files in this folder consist of experiments both for ensuring full understanding of MADS syntax and behavior for new additions to my [includes](https://github.com/idunmore/atari-8bit-includes-mads/tree/main) as well as for new MADS features.

For example, an enumeration-based enhancement to the way Display List entries are constructed, or the use of enumerated values in additive/ORing of “flag” and “bit setting” elements.

Items here may be promoted from here into the main set of include files along with suitable entries in the “[examples](https://github.com/idunmore/atari-8bit-includes-mads/tree/main/examples)” folder.   Depending on the nature, duration and success/failure of any given experiment, such promotion _may_ result in removal from this folder.
